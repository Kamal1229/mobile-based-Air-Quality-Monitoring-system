# mobile-based-Air-Quality-Monitoring-system
This project is a compact and efficient air quality monitoring system using the ESP32 microcontroller and the MQ-135 gas sensor. It detects harmful gases such as Carbon Monoxide (CO), Carbon Dioxide (COâ‚‚), and LPG from the environment. The collected data is transmitted via WiFi to the ThingSpeak cloud platform, enabling users to remotely monitor air quality through a mobile device. This system is ideal for smart homes and urban air pollution tracking due to its simplicity, low cost, and real-time data access.
